/**
Main interface for opening and working with a dynamic link library.

**Note:** Several methods have their "*_cstr" equivalents. This is because all native OS
interfaces actually use C-strings. If you pass
[`CStr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html)
as an argument, Library doesn't need to perform additional conversion from Rust string to
C-string.. This makes `*_cstr" functions slightly more optimal than their normal equivalents.
It is recommended that you use
[const-cstr](https://github.com/abonander/const-cstr) crate to create statically allocated
C-strings.

**Note:** The handle to the library gets released when the library object gets dropped.
Unless your application opened the library multiple times, this is the moment when symbols
obtained from the library become dangling symbols.

    Open a dynamic library.

    **Note:** different platforms search for libraries in different directories.
    Therefore this function cannot be 100% platform independent.
    However it seems that all platforms support the full path and
    searching in default os directories if you provide only the file name.
    Please refer to your operating system guide for precise information about the directories
    where the operating system searches for dynamic link libraries.

    ```no_run

    use dlopen::raw::Library;

    fn main() {
        //use full path
        let lib = Library::open("/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6").unwrap();

    Obtain symbol from opened library.

    **Note:** the `T` template type needs to have a size of a pointer.
    Because Rust does not support static casts at the moment, the size of the type
    is checked in runtime and causes panic if it doesn't match.

    **Note:** It is legal for a library to export null symbols.
    However this is something that almost nobody expects.
    Therefore allowing it here would bring many problems, especially if user obtains references
    or functions.
    This method checks the address value and returns `Error::NullSymbol` error if the value is null.
    If your code does require obtaining symbols with null value, please do something like this:

    # Example

    ```no_run

    use dlopen::Error;
