/**
Safe wrapper around dynamic link library handle.

Methods of `Library` return only types that make the library borrowed. Therefore the problem with
dangling symbols is prevented.

**Note:**: It is recommended that you use certain methods in certain situations:

* `symbol()` - for obtaining functions and pointers (but only if you can't use references
    instead of pointers and you do not accept null value of a pointer).
* `reference()` and `reference_mut()` - for obtaining access to
    statically allocated objects - either constant or mutable.
* `ptr_or_null()` and `ptr_or_null_mut()` - for obtaining pointers if you accept null values of
pointers (in 99% of cases you should rather use previously mentioned methods).

# Example

```no_run
extern crate dlopen;
use dlopen::symbor::Library;

fn main(){
    let lib = Library::open("libexample.dylib").unwrap();
    let fun = unsafe{lib.symbol::<unsafe extern "C" fn()>("function")}.unwrap();
    unsafe{fun()};
    let glob_val: &mut u32 = unsafe{lib.reference_mut("glob_val")}.unwrap();
    *glob_val = 42;
    let ptr_or_null = unsafe{lib.ptr_or_null::<()>("void_ptr")}.unwrap();
    println!("Pointer is null: {}", ptr_or_null.is_null());
}
```
