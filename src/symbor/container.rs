/**
Container for both dynamic link library handle and its API.

This structure solves an important issue: object oriented programming where the given
structure has two objects and one of the objects has a reference to the second one.
Normally you can't put `Library` and a structure that implements `SymBorApi` into one structure.
This structure allows you to do it.

#Example

```no_run
#[macro_use]
extern crate dlopen_derive;
extern crate dlopen;
use dlopen::symbor::{Library, Symbol, Ref, PtrOrNull, SymBorApi, Container};

 #[derive(SymBorApi)]
 struct ExampleApi<'a> {
    pub fun: Symbol<'a, unsafe extern "C" fn(i32) -> i32>,
    pub glob_i32: Ref<'a, i32>,
    pub maybe_c_str: PtrOrNull<'a, u8>,
 }

fn main(){
    let cont: Container<ExampleApi> = unsafe{Container::load("libexample.so")}
        .expect("Could not load library or symbols");
    println!("fun(4)={}", unsafe{(cont.fun)(4)});
    println!("glob_i32={}", *cont.glob_i32);
    println!("The pointer is null={}", cont.maybe_c_str.is_null());
}
```
